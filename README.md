# ganga-tools
Ganga tools and extensions for LHCb

## Plugins (splitters, checkers, etc.)
### LHCbCompleteChecker
A _checker_ that ensures that all input files were fully processed
(using the metadata). This is a simplified version of the existing
`LHCbMetaDataChecker`, which also overcomes some deficiencies.
This checker is not suitable if only part of the input is processed
(e.g. `EvtMax` is used).

Use:
```python
job.postprocessors.append(LHCbCompleteChecker())
```

### LHCbBookkeepingChecker
A _checker_ that compares the number of processed events as reported in
the metadata and the number of events from the bookkeeping
(_EventStat/FullStat_ field).
Fails if the processed and the expected number of events differ.
This checker is not suitable if only part of the input is processed
(e.g. `EvtMax` is used).

Use:
```python
job.postprocessors.append(LHCbBookkeepingChecker())
```

### SplitByFilesAndRun
A _splitter_ that is similar to `SplitByFiles` but ensures that each subjob's
input contains files from one _run_ only.
Expect many subjobs if using this splitter (at least as many as the number
of runs)!

Use (see `SplitByFiles`):
```python

job.splitter = SplitByFilesAndRun(filesPerJob=50)
```

## Tools (scripts)
### gdownload
Download job output files. Can also merge the downloaded files (ROOT only).
```sh
gdownload --help
```

### gmerge
Merge job output files directly (w/o downloading). Currenly only ROOT files are
supported.
```sh
gmerge --help
```

## Utility functions
These are python modules with utility functions to be used from interactive
Ganga shell or from scripts.
```python
from gutils import utils, download, merge
help(utils)
help(download)
help(merge)
```

## Setup instructions
First, clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/rmatev/ganga-tools.git ~/ganga-tools
```
Second, edit `~/.gangarc` by uncommenting `RUNTIME_PATH` and appending the
appropriate path, e.g.:
```
#RUNTIME_PATH = GangaDirac:GangaGaudi:GangaLHCb
```
becomes
```
RUNTIME_PATH = GangaDirac:GangaGaudi:GangaLHCb:~/ganga-tools/GangaLHCbExt
```
The default LHCb-specific value of `RUNTIME_PATH` can be found from
```
grep RUNTIME_PATH /cvmfs/ganga.cern.ch/Ganga/install/LATEST/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ganga/GangaLHCb/LHCb.in
```

Third, (optional) add `~/ganga-tools/scripts` to the `PATH` environment
variable, e.g. add in `~/.bashrc`:
```sh
export PATH=$HOME/ganga-tools/scripts:$PATH
```

Optionally, increase the number of user threads (default to 3) by uncommenting
and changing `# NumWorkerThreads = 3` in `~/.gangarc`
